        <h2>The Paris Olympics</h2>

        <p>This summer, I had an incredible experience visiting Paris for the 2024 Olympics. We first landed in Amsterdam, where we met up with a couple of family friends, and then took the bullet train over to Paris. The train was amazing, like a plane on the ground, offering a smooth and fast ride. We arrived right in the heart of Paris and checked into a hotel, which was a bit of a culture shock—especially with the separate toilet and shower, and the lack of air conditioning.</p>
        <p>Paris is definitely a walking city, so it took some adjusting not being able to drive everywhere, but the beauty and history of the city made it worth it. We also had the chance to visit London and explore iconic landmarks there, as well as take in the sights of Amsterdam. Overall, it was an amazing tourist experience.</p>

        <h2>Louisiana Trip and My Airport Disaster</h2>

        <p>I recently took a trip to Monroe, Louisiana, to visit my cousin Savannah, who moved there for college. The journey was extremely hectic because it happened right when the Microsoft server shutdown occurred, causing many flights to be canceled. I was bumped off around 10 flights and ended up spending the night in an airport.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I made it to New Orleans, which was still five hours away from Monroe, so my cousin had to make the long drive to pick me up. Despite the rough journey, once I got there, we had a great time! We went on a big shopping spree and tried all kinds of American fast food. Overall, it was a really rewarding trip, even though getting there was a challenge.</p>
